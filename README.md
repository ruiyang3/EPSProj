# EPSProj
The code repo for the **Generating Synthetic Data for Model Training** project in *Engineering Privacy in Software* course.

## Structure
The repo contains all the CoLab files for the project.
### Victim.ipynb
Train a 3-layer MLP model with real data and test the accuracy of the model.
### Victim_DP.ipynb
Train a 3-layer MLP model with real data under diffenrential privacy guarantee and test the accuracy of the model.
### Victim_SYN.ipynb
Train a 3-layer MLP model with synthetic data generated from real data and test the accuracy of the model.
### MIA.ipynb
The MIA pipeline for training a model on real data and build MIA to attack the model.
### DP MIA.ipynb
The MIA pipeline for training a model on real data with differential privacy guarantee and build MIA to attack the model.
### SYN MIA.ipynb
The MIA pipeline for training a model on synthetic data and build MIA to attack the model.
